The final chapters introduce functional (ML) and logic (Prolog) programming languages to demonstrate that imperative languages are not conceptual necessities for programming.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"UOM:39015037286278"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":384,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.9.6.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&q=programming&dq=programming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_Programming_Languages.html?hl=&id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book compares constructs from C with constructs from Ada in terms of levels of abstractions."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"b-2oDwAAQBAJ","etag":"KPtVIMsB6rI","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/b-2oDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Python Programming in Context","authors":["Bradley N.

The message from educators, the tech community, and even politicians is clear: everyone should learn to code. To emphasize the universality and importance of computer programming, promoters of coding for everyone often invoke the concept of “literacy,” drawing parallels between reading and writing code and reading and writing text. In this book, Annette Vee examines the coding-as-literacy analogy and argues that it can be an apt rhetorical frame. The theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming beyond a technical level, and in its historical, social, and conceptual contexts. Viewing programming from the perspective of literacy and literacy from the perspective of programming, she argues, shifts our understandings of both. Computer programming becomes part of an array of communication skills important in everyday life, and literacy, augmented by programming, becomes more capacious. Vee examines the ways that programming is linked with literacy in coding literacy campaigns, considering the ideologies that accompany this coupling, and she looks at how both writing and programming encode and distribute information. She explores historical parallels between writing and programming, using the evolution of mass textual literacy to shed light on the trajectory of code from military and government infrastructure to large-scale businesses to personal use. Writing and coding were institutionalized, domesticated, and then established as a basis for literacy. Just as societies demonstrated a “literate mentality” regardless of the literate status of individuals, Vee argues, a “computational mentality” is now emerging even though coding is still a specialized skill.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780262036245"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"026203624X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":375,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Coding_Literacy.html?hl=&id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books/download/Coding_Literacy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In this book, Annette Vee examines the coding-as-literacy analogy and argues that it can be an apt rhetorical frame."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"mh0bU6NXrBgC","etag":"mrZgQbpHsp8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mh0bU6NXrBgC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Core Python Programming","authors":["Wesley Chun"],"publisher":"Prentice Hall Professional","publishedDate":"2001","description":"Experts and novices alike will be able to find information about every command they'll need to use Linux.

This is the undisputed go-to guide to Rust, written by two members of the Rust core team, with feedback and contributions from 42 members of the community. The book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but makes no assumptions about which one, meaning the material is accessible and useful to developers from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. Known by the Rust community as “The Book,” The Rust Programming Language includes concept chapters, where you’ll learn about a particular aspect of Rust, and project chapters, where you’ll apply what you’ve learned so far to build small programs. The Book opens with a quick hands-on project to introduce the basics then explores key concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. Next come detailed explanations of Rust-oriented perspectives on topics like pattern matching, iterators, and smart pointers, with concrete examples and exercises--taking you from theory to practice. The Rust Programming Language will also show you how to: - Grasp important concepts unique to Rust, like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes - Use Cargo, Rust’s built-in package manager, to build and maintain your code, including downloading and building dependencies - Effectively use Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and employ your own You’ll learn to develop reliable code that’s speed and memory efficient, while avoiding the infamous and arcane programming pitfalls common at the systems level. When you need to dive down into lower-level control, this guide will show you how without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes and without requiring you to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain. You’ll also learn how to create command line programs, build single- and multithreaded web servers, and much more. The Rust Programming Language fully embraces Rust’s potential to empower its users. This friendly and approachable guide will help you build not only your knowledge of Rust but also your ability to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781593278519"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1593278519"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":553,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.2.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rust_Programming_Language.html?hl=&id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This is the undisputed go-to guide to Rust, written by two members of the Rust core team, with feedback and contributions from 42 members of the community."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"eHq9CgAAQBAJ","etag":"rV4mwlMcWxs","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eHq9CgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Start Programming Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript","authors":["Iztok Fajfar"],"publisher":"CRC Press","publishedDate":"2015-10-14","description":"This text is a manual for undergraduate students in engineering and the natural sciences to discover how computer programming works.

This book is also designed for software programmers who want to learn the C programming language from scratch. It provides you with an adequate understanding of the programming language. From there, you can bring yourself towards a higher level of expertise. While you are not really required to have any previous experience with computer programming, you still need to have a basic understanding of the terms commonly used in programming and computers. You see, the C language is one of the most recommended computer programming languages for beginners. After all, it is a predecessor to many of the modern programming languages used today, such as Java and Python. In other words, before you can effectively learn these languages, you have to have a clear understanding of the C language first. Through this book, you will learn how to write your first programs and see how they work in real time. You have to keep in mind that it is perfectly okay to make mistakes every now and then. It is through these mistakes that you learn. So, when you encounter an error on your program, you just have to study the part where you went wrong and redo it. When you run the programs in the C language, you will be notified in case you made a mistake. You will see the error and know which line you have to modify. This book also teaches you how you can write the shortest programs possible, without negatively affecting your output. As a programmer, you want to make the most of your available time and space while still being efficient. You will also learn how to organise your codes and include remarks via comments so that you and your readers will not get confused.

The authors lay out a proven strategy that forces the reader to plan as their software project unfolds, and therefore avoid many of the nasty problems that can potentially spring up along the way.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0201710919"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780201710915"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":162,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":6,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.4.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Planning_Extreme_Programming.html?hl=&id=u13hVoYVZa8C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In this new book, noted software engineers Kent Beck and Martin Fowler show the reader how to properly plan a software development project with XP in mind."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"s-IH_x6ytuQC","etag":"dbvxQlaqjBc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/s-IH_x6ytuQC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The C# Programming Language (Covering C# 4.0), Portable Documents","authors":["Anders Hejlsberg","Mads Torgersen","Scott Wiltamuth","Peter Golde"],"publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","publishedDate":"2010-10-31","description":"The popular C# programming language combines the high productivity of rapid application development languages with the raw power of C and C++. Updated to cover the new features of C# 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, and covariant and contravariant generic types, this release takes the language to the next level by adding the ability to cleanly write programs that don’t rely on static type definitions. This allows dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to feel native to C#. The C# Programming Language, Fourth Edition, continues to be the authoritative and annotated technical reference for C# 4.0. 7nbsp; Written by Anders Hejlsberg, the language’s architect, and his colleagues, Mads Torgersen, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde, this volume has been completely updated for C# 4.0. The book provides the complete specification of the language, along with descriptions, reference materials, code samples, and annotations from twelve prominent C# gurus. The many annotations bring a depth and breadth of understanding rarely found in any programming book. As the main text of the book introduces the concepts of the C# language, cogent annotations explain why they are important, how they are used, how they relate to other languages, and even how they evolved. This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#. With annotations from: Brad Abrams, Joseph Albahari, Krzysztof Cwalina, Jesse Liberty, Eric Lippert, Christian Nagel, Vladimir Reshetnikov, Marek Safar, Chris Sells, Peter Sestoft, Jon Skeet, and Bill Wagner.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780132481724"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0132481723"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":1073,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.13.11.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":759.05,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":759.05,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&rdid=book-s-IH_x6ytuQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":759050000,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":759050000,"currencyCode":"EGP"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#.
